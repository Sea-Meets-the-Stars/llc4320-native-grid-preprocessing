# Generate a density grid for one tile

## Goals

Following the code in llc4320-native-grid-preprocessing/dev/generate_global_depth_dask.py, generate a density grid for one tile.  Save it as a netcdf file with coordinates.

## Context

Examine the code in llc4320-native-grid-preprocessing/dev/ and 
llc4320-native-grid-preprocessing/src/dbof

## Coding

Follow these guidelines:

- Use inline comments to explain the code.
- Use matplotlib
- Use dask when useful
- Code in Python
- Place imports at the top of modules
- Reuse any code in this repository to help you

## Testing

If you need to run Python, use the "ocean14" conda environment.

## Functionality

- The user will specify the i,j coordinates. The code will then identify the tile to generate the density grid for.
- The user will specify the timestamp of the data to use.
- The user will specify the output file name.
- The code will generate the density grid for the specified tile and timestamp.
- The code will save the density grid to the specified output file.

## Planning

### Plan

**Target script**: `dev/generate_tile_density.py` (single-file, callable from CLI and importable).

**Scope** (per the clarification answers):

- Output a **3D potential-density tile** of shape `(k=51, j=720, i=720)` — one on-disk zarr chunk in spatial extent, all 51 k-levels.
- "Potential density" → use `jmd95` with `p = 0` at every k-level, then `sigma0 = rho − 1000`. Only `sigma0` is written (not in-situ density).
- Read tracers from the S3 timestep stores (the same source used by `generate_global_depth_dask.py`).

**Re-used building blocks already in the repo**:

- `dbof.utils.jmd95_xgcm_implementation.jmd95(salt, theta, p)` — JMD95 EOS, numpy-based.
- `dbof.utils.physical_calculations.density_of_field(ds)` — wraps `jmd95` in `xr.apply_ufunc(..., dask="parallelized")` with `p=0`. Works on any (face, k, j, i) subset, so we apply it directly to the tile after slicing — that gives **potential density at every k-level** with no extra code.
- `dbof.llc4320_ingestion.get_raw_data.get_s3_timestep_data(...)` — opens the full timestep store **lazily** with native zarr chunks `{face:1, k:51, j:720, i:720}`. Slicing one `(face, k=all, j=720, i=720)` block before `.compute()` triggers exactly one S3 GET per variable per chunk — the natural unit for a one-tile job.
- `dbof.llc4320_ingestion.get_raw_data.get_s3_gridfile(...)` — loads `grid.zarr`.
- `dbof.preprocessing.preproc_llc_core_data.process_llc4320_3d_grid(...)` — extracts `XC`, `YC`, `Z`, `hFacC`, etc.
- `generate_global_depth_dask._date_to_iteration` — already converts `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'` → iteration count; imported, not duplicated.
- S3 endpoint / bucket / folder defaults pulled from `configs/global_depth.yaml` (`s3_source` block).

**Tile geometry** (tiles are identified on the **rectangular grid**, per round-2 answer #2):

- Global rectangular grid: `H = 3·4320 = 12960`, `W = 4·4320 = 17280`.
- Tile = a 720×720 spatial block on the rect grid × 51 k-levels (one native chunk).
- The rect grid has `n_tile_j = 18` rows × `n_tile_i = 24` cols = **432 tiles total**, indexed flat in row-major order: `tile_idx = tile_j_rect * 24 + tile_i_rect`, range `0..431`.
- Any rect pixel `(i_rect, j_rect)` floors to its enclosing tile: `tile_j_rect = j_rect // 720`, `tile_i_rect = i_rect // 720`. Every pixel inside a tile maps to the same `tile_idx` — so the user can pass *any* point inside the desired tile.
- Because rect tiles align to face-chunk boundaries and each face is 6×6 tiles, a single rect tile is guaranteed to live entirely on one face (possibly with a per-face rotation that swaps/reverses the face-local j and i ranges).

**Helper to build**: `rect_ij_to_tile(i_rect, j_rect) → dict(tile_idx, tile_j_rect, tile_i_rect, rect_j_slice, rect_i_slice, face_idx, j_face_slice, i_face_slice)`.

- Step A — rect-tile math (no I/O, no xmitgcm): `tile_j_rect = j_rect // 720`, `tile_i_rect = i_rect // 720`, `tile_idx = tile_j_rect * 24 + tile_i_rect`, `rect_j_slice = slice(tile_j_rect*720, (tile_j_rect+1)*720)`, likewise for `i`.
- Step B — face mapping: synthesize a small `xr.Dataset` with three int arrays `face_id`, `j_face`, `i_face` of dims `(face, j, i)` filled with the face index and face-local j/i values, then run them through `dbof.utils.faces_to_latlon.faces_dataset_to_latlon` once per invocation. Sample those three arrays over the tile's rect slice. The unique value of `face_id` gives `face_idx`; the min/max of `j_face` and `i_face` inside the tile give `j_face_slice` and `i_face_slice` — this handles any per-face rotation automatically.
- Step C — sanity check: assert `face_id` is constant across the 720×720 rect tile (it must be, given chunk alignment) and that both face-local slices span exactly 720 pixels.
- The lookup arrays are tiny (`face_id` int8, `j_face`/`i_face` int16) and only built once per invocation.

**Pipeline (per invocation)**:

1. **Parse inputs** — CLI args:
   - `--i` (int, required) — rect-grid i coord, `0..17279`. Any pixel inside the desired tile is accepted.
   - `--j` (int, required) — rect-grid j coord, `0..12959`.
   - `--timestamp` (str, required) — `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'`.
   - `--output` (str, optional) — defaults to `./density_tile{tile_idx:03d}_{YYYYMMDDTHH}.nc` where `tile_idx` is the flat rect-grid tile index `0..431` (round-2 answer #1). If the user passes a directory, the same convention is applied inside it.
   - `--s3-config` (path, optional) — defaults to `configs/global_depth.yaml`.
2. **Resolve tile** — call `rect_ij_to_tile(i, j)`; log `tile_idx`, `tile_j_rect`, `tile_i_rect`, `face_idx`, and both face-local and rect slices. Validate that the tile is not entirely land by inspecting the surface `hFacC` across the tile (see step 7) — abort with a clear error if every cell is land.
3. **Load grid (one face)** — `get_s3_gridfile(...)` → `process_llc4320_3d_grid(...)` → `.isel(face=[face_idx], j=j_face_slice, i=i_face_slice).compute()`. We end up with `XC`, `YC`, `Z`, `hFacC` for just the tile. Negligible memory.
4. **Lazy-open the timestep store** — `get_s3_timestep_data(s3_endpoint, bucket, folder, date_str, face_range=[face_idx], vars_requested=['Theta','Salt'])`. Result is dask-backed with native chunks.
5. **Slice the tile** — `ds_tile = ds.isel(face=[0], j=j_face_slice, i=i_face_slice)`. Still lazy. Shape `(face=1, k=51, j=720, i=720)` per variable.
6. **Compute potential density** — call `density_of_field(ds_tile)`. Since `density_of_field` passes `p = zeros_like(Theta)` into `jmd95`, this yields **potential density referenced to the surface at every k-level** — exactly what was requested. Then `sigma0 = rho - 1000.0`. Trigger materialization with one `.compute()` (using `ProgressBar`).
7. **Apply land mask** — use **surface `hFacC` only** (round-2 answer #4): build `land2d = (ds_grid_tile.hFacC.isel(k=0) == 0)` of shape `(j=720, i=720)` and broadcast across all 51 k-levels: `sigma0 = sigma0.where(~land2d)`. Whole water column is NaN wherever the surface cell is land.
8. **Assemble output `xr.Dataset`** with:
   - data var `sigma0` (`[kg m⁻³]`, dtype float32),
   - dims `(k, j, i)` of size `(51, 720, 720)` — `j`, `i` are face-local indices,
   - coords `XC(j, i)`, `YC(j, i)` (2D lon/lat per round-2 answer #3), `Z(k)`, plus scalar coords `tile_index`, `face_index`, `rect_i_start`, `rect_j_start`,
   - attrs: `timestamp`, `iteration`, `tile_index`, `tile_j_rect`, `tile_i_rect`, `face_index`, `rect_i_user`, `rect_j_user`, `eos="JMD95"`, `reference_pressure_dbar=0`, `source_script`, `git_commit` (via `subprocess` `git rev-parse HEAD` if available).
9. **Save** — build output path: if `--output` is omitted use `./density_tile{tile_idx:03d}_{YYYYMMDDTHH}.nc`; if a directory is supplied apply the same convention inside it; else use the path verbatim. Then `ds_out.to_netcdf(output_path, engine='h5netcdf', encoding={'sigma0': {'zlib': True, 'complevel': 4, 'dtype': 'float32'}})`.
10. **QA plot** — matplotlib `pcolormesh` of `sigma0.isel(k=0)` saved as `<output_stem>.png` next to the NetCDF; uses `XC`, `YC` as the axes so the panel is geographic-looking (surface panel only, per round-2 answer #5).

**Dask use**:

- The tile holds `2 vars × 51 k × 720² × 4 B ≈ 210 MB` lazy → trivial in memory.
- Per-variable, S3 reads one chunk (`face=1, k=51, j=720, i=720` ≈ 100 MB compressed). The `density_of_field` `apply_ufunc(..., dask="parallelized")` path keeps the computation lazy until step 6's single `.compute()`.
- No `dask.distributed.Client` — the default threaded scheduler is sufficient.

**Reusability**: import `_date_to_iteration` and `LLC_FACES` from `generate_global_depth_dask.py`; import `LOCAL_CACHE_DIR` only if we add a caching flag later (not in v1).

**Testing**: add `tests/test_generate_tile_density.py` with:

- A unit test for the **flat tile-index math**: assert `tile_idx == tile_j_rect * 24 + tile_i_rect` for a spread of (i_rect, j_rect) values, including off-boundary pixels that must floor to the same tile, and the corner cases `(0, 0) → 0` and `(17279, 12959) → 431`.
- A unit test for `rect_ij_to_tile`'s face-mapping step: known (rect_i, rect_j) → expected (face_idx, face-local slices) on a few representative tiles, including at least one tile on a face that the xmitgcm stitch rotates.
- A round-trip test that monkey-patches `get_s3_timestep_data` and `get_s3_gridfile` to return small synthetic in-memory zarr-like datasets, runs the main entrypoint, and checks the output NetCDF has the expected dims, the surface-`hFacC` mask propagated to all 51 k-levels, the filename matches `density_tile{NNN}_{YYYYMMDDTHH}.nc`, and a known `sigma0` value (`jmd95(35.5, 3., 0.) - 1000 ≈ 28.1`).
- Run with the `ocean14` conda env (`conda run -n ocean14 pytest tests/test_generate_tile_density.py`).

### Clarification

1. **No `Analysis/py` exists** in this repo. The prompt's coding guideline "Use the modules in Analysis/py to load any data" appears to be a template leftover. Plan substitutes `dbof.llc4320_ingestion.get_raw_data` and `dbof.preprocessing.preproc_llc_core_data` for data loading — please confirm.

That is correct. I have removed the reference to Analysis/py.

2. **Interpretation of (i, j)**: I'm assuming `(i, j)` are pixel coordinates on the *global rectangular* stitched grid (range `0..17279` for `i`, `0..12959` for `j`), and the code resolves the face index from the xmitgcm tile layout. Alternatives the user might mean: (a) native (face, j, i) where i, j are already face-local — in which case we also need an explicit `--face` arg; or (b) lon/lat to be looked up via `XC`, `YC`. Which convention is intended?

That is correct. i,j are on the global rectangular grid.  

3. **Surface or 3D**: should the output be a 2D surface density grid (faster, ~150 MB) or a full 3D depth-resolved density (51 levels, ~7.5 GB float32)? Default in the plan is surface; happy to flip.

The output should be the full 3D density grid.  However, instead of a full face, just write out one tile (720x720).  This means the code must use i,j to find the tile and not the face.

4. **In-situ vs. potential density**: include `sigma0 = jmd95(S, T, p=0) - 1000` as an extra variable, or stick with in-situ `rho` only?

Calculate only the potential density, not in-situ.

5. **Data source**: read from the S3 timestep stores (matching `generate_global_depth_dask.py`'s `s3_source`) or from a local cached zarr under `LOCAL_CACHE_DIR` / a user-supplied path?

Read from the S3 timestep stores.

6. **Output filename rule** — interpret `--output` as a full path the user provides verbatim, or apply a convention like `density_tile{F}_{YYYYMMDDTHH}.nc` if a directory is given?

Have the output filename be optional.  It should default to `density_tile{F}_{YYYYMMDDTHH}.nc` in the current directory.

### Additional Clarifications (round 2)

These are new questions raised by the round-2 plan; the original 1–6 above are answered and untouched.

1. **What does `{F}` stand for in the default filename `density_tile{F}_{YYYYMMDDTHH}.nc`?** Three plausible interpretations:
   (a) the face index alone (0–12) — ambiguous since a face contains 36 tiles;
   (b) a flat global tile index (0–431) over the rectangular grid;
   (c) a composite like `f{face}_j{tile_j}_i{tile_i}` (e.g., `f5_j2_i4`).
   I lean toward (c) because it uniquely identifies the tile and is human-readable. Confirm?

Please use option (b).  The face index is not needed because the code will use i,j to find the tile.

2. **Are the user-supplied `(i, j)` required to be tile-aligned** (i.e., multiples of 720 in face-local coordinates), or should the code accept any pixel inside the desired tile and floor down to the enclosing tile boundary? My plan does the latter; please confirm.

The user supplied i,j are on the global rectangular grid.  The code must figure out which tile they are in and then process that entire tile.

3. **Output coordinate convention**: keep the spatial dims named `j, i` (face-local indices, 0–719) and carry `XC(j,i)`, `YC(j,i)` as 2D lon/lat coords, or rename the dims to `j_rect, i_rect` with the rectangular-grid integer indices? Current plan uses face-local for the dim names and exposes the rect-grid start as scalar attrs — please confirm.

Carry the XC, YC coordinates as 2D lon/lat coords.

4. **`hFacC` masking**: should the land mask use only the surface `hFacC` (mask whole water column where surface is land), or per-level `hFacC` (so partially-filled bottom cells stay valid above and become NaN below)? Current plan uses per-level — confirm.

Use only the surface hFacC.

5. **QA plot scope**: is one `pcolormesh` of the surface `sigma0(k=0)` enough, or would you prefer additional panels (e.g., a vertical section at the tile midline)? Current plan: just the surface panel.

The surface panel is enough.
